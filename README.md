# IoRailsApp

When you have an idea, you want to translate it quickly into a working app rather than spending hours on basic setup tasks such as user signin/signup, layout style, default home page. IoRailsApp lets you concentrate on what makes your idea unique and valuable: its features.


## Usage

To create a new app, just type `rails_c your_app_name` and follow the wizard.
